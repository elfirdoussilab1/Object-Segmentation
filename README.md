# Object-Segmentation

In this repository, we apply object-segmentation algorithms to different tasks like counting objects of the same class that appear in an image or a video. The main methods that have been used to do so include the object detection algorithm YOLO (You Only Look Once), and a file called **sort** that attributes to each object an id.

To be able to run all these experiments, you should install all the required libraies that you can find in the file:

## Car Counter:
In the car counter file, we implement an algorithm that counts how many different cars traverse a road. For this purpose, we use
